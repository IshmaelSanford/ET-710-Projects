# Project 11 Report

## Summary
Project 11 focuses on the integration of custom graphics into a web page. I displayed a "composite image," which is a single image created by combining multiple source images using image editing software like Photoshop. The HTML page is styled to showcase the artwork, using a dark background to make the image pop. The caption describes the creative process, including the use of layers, masking, and filters to achieve the final result.

## Critical Thinking Questions & Answers

1.  **What is a composite image?**
    A composite image is a graphic created by combining two or more separate images to create a new, single image. This is often done to create surreal scenes, place a subject in a new background, or combine the best elements of multiple photos.

2.  **Why is image optimization important for the web?**
    Composite images can become very large in file size due to the high resolution and detail required for editing. For the web, it is crucial to optimize these images (compress them) to ensure the page loads quickly. A 10MB image will slow down the site significantly compared to a 200KB optimized version.

3.  **What is the difference between "image dimensions" and "file size"?**
    Image dimensions refer to the width and height of the image in pixels (e.g., 1920x1080). File size refers to how much storage space the image takes up on the disk (e.g., 2.5 MB). Reducing dimensions usually reduces file size, but you can also reduce file size without changing dimensions by increasing compression.

4.  **What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag?**
    The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image. This text is displayed if the image fails to load and is read aloud by screen readers for visually impaired users. It is a critical component of web accessibility.

5.  **How do layers work in image editing?**
    Layers are like transparent sheets of glass stacked on top of each other. You can paint or place an image on one layer without affecting the layers below it. This allows for non-destructive editing, where you can move, resize, or hide individual elements of the composition independently.
