# Project 6 Report

## Summary
This project explores the three most common image formats used on the web: JPEG, PNG, and GIF. I created a 2x2 table layout to display examples of each format side-by-side. Each cell contains an image and a description of the format's characteristics and best use cases. This visual comparison helps in understanding when to choose one format over another.

## Critical Thinking Questions & Answers

1.  **When should you use JPEG over PNG?**
    JPEG is the best choice for photographs or realistic images with smooth gradients and millions of colors. Its lossy compression algorithm can significantly reduce file size for these types of images without a noticeable loss in quality. PNG files for photos can be much larger.

2.  **What is the main advantage of PNG?**
    PNG supports alpha transparency, meaning you can have images with semi-transparent backgrounds or edges that blend smoothly into the webpage background. It also uses lossless compression, so no image data is lost, making it ideal for line art, logos, and text.

3.  **Why is GIF limited to 256 colors?**
    GIF is an older format that uses an 8-bit palette, meaning it can only display a maximum of 256 distinct colors from the RGB spectrum. This makes it unsuitable for high-quality photographs but fine for simple graphics and icons.

4.  **What is the difference between "lossy" and "lossless" compression?**
    Lossy compression (like JPEG) permanently removes some image data to reduce file size, which can cause artifacts if compressed too much. Lossless compression (like PNG and GIF) reduces file size without losing any original image data, so the image quality remains perfect.

5.  **Why might you use a GIF today?**
    Despite its color limitations, GIF is still widely used for simple animations (like memes or banner ads) because it is supported by every browser and doesn't require video player plugins.
