# Web UI Time Museum

This is a project exploring how web interfaces have changed over time. It's a virtual tour that starts with the early text-only days, goes through the wild west of Geocities personal pages, and ends up at the desktop-like experience of Windows XP.

I built this to show the progression from pure utility to personal expression and finally to the structured GUI applications we're more familiar with today.

## Thanks and Resources

Feel free to look around the code and see how it all works.
