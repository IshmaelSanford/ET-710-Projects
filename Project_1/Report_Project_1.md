# Project 1 Report

## Summary
This project involved creating a basic web page using XHTML 1.0 Transitional syntax. I wrote the code manually, ensuring that all tags were properly opened and closed, and that they were all in lowercase as required by XHTML standards. The page includes a main heading, a few paragraphs introducing myself and my goals, and an unordered list of things I want to learn. This exercise helped me understand the fundamental structure of an HTML document, including the `html`, `head`, and `body` tags.

## Critical Thinking Questions & Answers

1.  **Why is it important to close all tags in XHTML?**
    In XHTML, strict syntax rules require all elements to be closed (e.g., `<p>...</p>` or `<br />`). This ensures that the document structure is unambiguous and can be parsed correctly by all browsers and XML parsers.

2.  **What is the purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration?**
    The DOCTYPE declaration tells the web browser which version of HTML or XHTML the page is written in. This helps the browser render the page correctly according to the specified standard (in this case, XHTML 1.0 Transitional).

3.  **Why do we use lowercase tags in XHTML?**
    XHTML is based on XML, which is case-sensitive. Therefore, standard HTML tags must be written in lowercase (e.g., `<body>` not `<BODY>`) to be valid XHTML.

4.  **What is the difference between the `<head>` and `<body>` sections?**
    The `<head>` section contains metadata about the document, such as the title and character set, which are not displayed directly on the page. The `<body>` section contains the actual content (text, images, lists) that is visible to the user in the browser window.

5.  **Why might we use an unordered list (`<ul>`) instead of an ordered list (`<ol>`)?**
    We use an unordered list when the order of the items does not matter, such as a list of groceries or hobbies. An ordered list is used when the sequence is important, like in a recipe or a set of instructions.
